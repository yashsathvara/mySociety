# Society Management System - Technologies Used

This project utilizes a set of modern technologies for both the frontend and backend to ensure a seamless and efficient experience for users. Below is a list of the key technologies used in the development of this system.

---

## Frontend Technologies

The **frontend** of the Society Management System is designed to provide an interactive and responsive user interface. The following technologies are used:

### 1. **React**

- React is used to build the user interface of the application. It helps in creating a dynamic, fast, and responsive web application.

### 2. **Vite**

- Vite is a modern build tool that provides faster development and build processes. It helps in faster loading times for the application.

### 3. **Tailwind CSS**

- Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. It allows us to build custom, responsive designs quickly by using utility classes.

### 4. **React Router DOM**

- React Router DOM is used for navigation between different pages and components in the application. It helps in creating a single-page application (SPA) with smooth transitions between views.

### 5. **Axios**

- Axios is a promise-based HTTP client used to make requests to the backend. It allows the frontend to communicate with the backend for fetching data and submitting forms.

### 6. **Socket.IO Client**

- Socket.IO Client is used to establish a real-time, bi-directional communication between the client (frontend) and server (backend). It enables live notifications, messaging, and event updates.

---

## Backend Technologies

The **backend** of the Society Management System is responsible for handling business logic, user authentication, data management, and communication with the database. Below are the technologies used:

### 1. **Node.js**

- Node.js is used as the runtime environment for running JavaScript code on the server. It allows us to handle backend operations and create APIs efficiently.

### 2. **Express**

- Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the creation of routes, middleware, and API endpoints for the application.

### 3. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**

- JWT is used for secure authentication and authorization. It allows users to log in and access protected resources in the application.

### 4. **Bcrypt**

- Bcrypt is used for hashing passwords. It helps in securely storing user passwords in the database by encrypting them.

### 5. **Cloudinary**

- Cloudinary is used for managing and uploading images and other media files. It helps store images like profile pictures and document uploads in the cloud.

### 6. **Nodemailer**

- Nodemailer is used for sending emails. It is useful for sending password reset emails, notifications, and other messages to users.

## Database

The **database** stores all the data for the Society Management System. The following database technology is used:

### 1. **MongoDB**

- MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store data in a flexible, scalable format. It is ideal for handling large amounts of data and provides fast data access with its document-based structure.

---

## Other Tools and Libraries

In addition to the core technologies, several other tools and libraries are used to enhance the functionality of the application:

- **CORS**: Used for handling cross-origin requests.
- **dotenv**: Used to manage environment variables in a secure way.
- **Mongoose**: A library used to interact with MongoDB in an easier and more structured way.
- **Moment.js**: Used for handling and formatting dates and times.
